Challenge 2 : Prompt Engineering

## How would you refine this prompt to improve the output? 

There is a lot of ambiguity in the prompt. I would ask for a short clarification on why exactly the AI categorizes the ad as host_read or producer_read. Also why it thinks it is Direct Response or Brand Awareness.

## How would you find tune it? 

I would try to find out what the AI is looking for in the ad to categorize it as host_read or producer_read. I would also try to find out what the AI is looking for to categorize it as Direct Response or Brand Awareness.

## Explain how you would train a model or refind and test a prompt like this to further improve Podscribe's automated ad scoring feature?

As a first step, to train the model I would use more manually trained data.
